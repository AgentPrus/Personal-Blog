## Who am I?

Hi, my name is Mykyta, I'm living in Lviv, Ukraine. Currently working as a React frontend developer at [ekreative](https://www.ekreative.com/). Also, I like trail running🏃, hiking🥾, reading books📚 and writing code💻 but not only😅.

## What this blog will be about

In this blog, I will be sharing my experience in different areas of my life (to be honest mostly it will be about coding and sport cause these are things I'm doing the most). I hope someone finds some helpful and interesting stuff for themselves...

Best regards Mykyta✌️

See you 👋 .
