## The paradox of choice

Recently I've noticed that I often hear from people who want to get their first job in IT questions like where should I start and what should I learn. It's a fair question cause even experienced developers struggle with dozens of tons of information that comes from everywhere.

So that's why I wrote this series articles where I'm going to share my thoughts and give some advice which I hope help you.

## First thing first

First of all, when you've just started your path I definitely recommend you to decide what you're going to do, what do I mean... For example, you're wanna building websites or web applications, that's great but the next thing you should figure out what you should know in order to accomplish your goal. So, that's the main problem is, to choose the right tech stack to reach your goal. I can't give you an answer what the right stack, or what you should learn to be successful, but I'll give you advice and examples which helped me in my career and I hope help you to make the right choice.

## Lat's talk about tech stack

> A tech stack is a kinda set of tools that help you more easily solve your problems.

For example, if you're going to build an online store first of all you need to choose which tools you're going to use to successfully accomplish your goal. And this set of tools which you're going to choose, also called **tech stack**.

## How to choose tech stack?

As I mentioned above, you need to know which problems you're going to solve. Let's take an example.

I wanna build a blog, what I should know to build a blog. First of all, I need to know how the web works because my working environment is a web 😅. Next, I need to learn some basic tools for building and styling web pages for now this is HTML, CSS. Okay, that's great but if I wanna interact with users for this purpose I need to learn JS and so on and so forth... I hope you get my point 😊.

## Final thoughts

I know when you have just started your journey it's hard to learn all this stuff and even harder to find what exactly do you need because of so much information that's why a lot of my acquaintances quit trying...

But you are not a first-person who faced these challenges, and there are some nice people who did a roadmap in order to make you and my life easier (Thanks guys 👍).

Here this [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps) which I hope help you to get you first job or mastering your skills.
